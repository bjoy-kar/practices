				//JavaScript Strings

				//A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".

				//var carName = "Volvo XC60";   // Using double quotes

				/*==========================================================================*/

				//JavaScript Numbers

				//JavaScript has only one type of numbers.

				//Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:

				//var x1 = 34.00;     // Written with decimals
				//var x2 = 34;        // Written without decimals 

				/*==========================================================================*/

				//JavaScript Booleans

				//Booleans can only have two values: true or false.

				//var x = 5;
				//var y = 5;
				//var z = 6;
				//(x == y)       // Returns true
				//(x == z)       // Returns false 

				/*==========================================================================*/

				//JavaScript Arrays

				//JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.

				//Array items are separated by commas.

				//The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names):

				//var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

				/*==========================================================================*/

				//JavaScript Objects

				//JavaScript objects are written with curly braces.

				//Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.

				//var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

				/*==========================================================================*/

				//Null

				//In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.

				//Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.

				//You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.

				//You can empty an object by setting it to null:

				//var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
				//person = null;        // Now value is null, but type is still an object
